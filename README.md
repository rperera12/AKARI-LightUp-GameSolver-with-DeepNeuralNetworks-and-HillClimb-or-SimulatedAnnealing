# AKARI-LightUp-GameSolver-with-DeepNeuralNetworks-and-HillClimb-or-SimulatedAnnealing
The purpose of this project was to apply the techniques we learned in Auburn University's COMP 6600/6606 Artificial Intelligence course to a new problem that we were interested in.  We chose to focus on the Light Up puzzle, and solved it using hill climbing, simulated annealing, and a deep neural network.
